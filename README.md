<h3>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles</h3>

➙  **Encapsulation**: Bundling the data (variables) and code (methods) together into a single unit called a class. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components and can prevent the accidental modification of data.
<br/>
➙  **Inheritance**: Mechanism where one class inherits the properties and behavior of another class. This allows for code reusability and the creation of a hierarchical relationship between classes.
<br/>
➙  **Polymorphism**: The ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface. It allows for methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon.
<br/>
➙  **Abstraction**: The concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object. It helps in reducing programming complexity and effort.

<h3>JavaFX for GUI Development</h3>

➙  Introduction to JavaFX for building modern graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in Java applications.
<br/>
➙  Tutorials and examples covering basic to advanced GUI components such as layouts, controls, styling, and event handling.
<br/>
➙  Integration of JavaFX with MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture for structured and maintainable GUI applications.
<br/>
<h3>Java OOP Projects</h3>

➙  Sample projects and tutorials demonstrating the power of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java.
<br/>
➙  Step-by-step guides to building applications using Java, covering core OOP principles such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
<br/>
➙  Advanced Java topics like design patterns, multithreading, collections framework, and using JavaFX for building rich desktop applications.
